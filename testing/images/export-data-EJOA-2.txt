ANSWER :
To allow communication between your Websphere Linux server and the Snowflake prod URI, you need to open specific firewall requests. Follow these general steps:

1. Identify the Snowflake prod URI: Obtain the hostname or IP address of the Snowflake prod server you need to connect to. This information should be provided by the Snowflake administrator.

2. Determine the communication protocol and port: Identify the protocol (HTTP, HTTPS, etc.) and port number that needs to be opened to establish a connection. Snowflake commonly uses HTTPS over port 443.

3. Configure the firewall on the Websphere Linux server:

   - Access the firewall configuration on the Websphere Linux server, which may vary based on the Linux distribution you are using.

   - Open the required port for incoming/outgoing traffic. For example, if the Snowflake prod URI uses HTTPS on port 443, you need to allow outbound traffic on port 443.

   - You can use the `iptables` command to open the required port. For instance, to open port 443, you can run the following command:

     ```
     sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
     ```

   - Make sure to save the firewall configuration so that it persists after system reboots.

4. Test the connection: After opening the firewall requests, attempt to establish a connection from the Websphere Linux server to the Snowflake prod URI. Verify that the communication is successful.

Note: The above steps provide a general guideline. It is recommended to consult your organization's network/security policies and involve the appropriate team responsible for firewall management to ensure compliance and avoid any unintended security risks.
