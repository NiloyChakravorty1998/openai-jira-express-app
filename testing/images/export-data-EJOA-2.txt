ANSWER :
To open firewall requests for Websphere Linux server to Snowflake prod URI, you need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the Snowflake prod URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that you need to connect to. This will typically be in the format of `<account_name>.<region>.snowflakecomputing.com`.

2. Log in to the firewall or security device that is responsible for managing the network traffic on the Websphere Linux server.

3. Locate the configuration settings for the firewall rules or access control lists (ACLs) that govern outbound traffic from the Websphere server.

4. Create a new rule or modify an existing rule to allow outbound traffic to the Snowflake prod URI.

5. Specify the protocol and port number that Snowflake uses for communication. Snowflake supports both HTTPS (TCP port 443) and HTTP (TCP port 80) protocols. It is recommended to use the HTTPS protocol for secure communication.

6. If you have a specific IP address or range that you want to allow traffic to the Snowflake prod URI, you can specify it in the rule. Otherwise, you can leave the source IP address as any or use a wildcard to match any source IP address.

7. Save the changes to the firewall configuration.

8. Test the connectivity from the Websphere Linux server to the Snowflake prod URI to ensure that the firewall rules are working correctly.

Note: It is essential to follow your organization's security policies and guidelines while making firewall rule changes. Make sure to involve the appropriate network and security teams to ensure compliance and security best practices.
